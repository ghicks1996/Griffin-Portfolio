<p>A really beautiful and deeply personal film about isolation, regret and lost love. Includes an incredible lead performance by Harry Dean Stanton.</p>
<h3>Chinatown</h3>

<p>My favorite Noir/Detective film starring my favorite actor Jack Nicholson, who plays a private-eye tasked with finding a woman's missing husband. This small mystery reveals a much larger conspiracy taking place in the city of L.A.</p>
